# Space Invaders

This is a classic Space Invaders game built using Python and the Pygame library.
Currently, the game only has a movable player spaceship.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2.  Install the Pygame library. Open your terminal and type: `pip install pygame`
3.  Run the main game file by typing: `python main.py`

Instructions for using the software:

1.  Use the **Left Arrow Key** to move the spaceship left.
2.  Use the **Right Arrow Key** to move the spaceship right.
3.  Close the game window to quit.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries:

- **Python** (Version 3.8 or newer)
- **Pygame** (Version 2.0 or newer)
- A code editor (like VS Code)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

- [Pygame Official Website](https://www.pygame.org/news) - The official documentation and news.
- [Pygame Tutorial for Beginners (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) - A helpful guide for starting with Pygame.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Add a `Laser` class so the player can shoot.
- [ ] Create `Alien` enemies that move across the screen.
- [ ] Add collision detection for lasers hitting aliens.
- [ ] Add collision detection for aliens hitting the player.
- [ ] Add game sounds and music.
- [ ] Create a start screen and a "Game Over" screen.
- [ ] Add shields for the player to hide behind.
