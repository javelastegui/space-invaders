# Space Invaders Clone

This is a classic Space Invaders game created using Python and the Pygame library. The objective is to defeat waves of aliens, destroy the mystery ship for bonus points, and achieve the highest score possible before you are defeated.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1.  Ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.
2.  Install the **Pygame** library by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing: `pip install pygame`
3.  Download all the project files and place them in the same directory, preserving the folder structure (e.g., `Graphics`, `Sounds`).
4.  Run the game by executing the `main.py` file: `python main.py`

Instructions for using the software (playing the game):

1.  **Move:** Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys to move your spaceship.
2.  **Shoot:** Press the **Spacebar** to shoot a laser.
3.  **Restart:** If the game is over, press the **Spacebar** to play again.
4.  **Objective:** Shoot all the aliens and the mystery ship to score points. Avoid being hit by alien lasers. You have 3 lives.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3 (developed using Python 3.9+)
- Pygame (specifically `pygame.mixer` for sounds and `pygame.sprite` for game objects)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

- [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
- [Space Invaders Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFMoo_dvhyw&t=1909s)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

- [ ] Add a main menu and start screen.
- [ ] Implement multiple, progressively harder levels.
- [ ] Add player power-ups, like a faster shot or a temporary shield.
